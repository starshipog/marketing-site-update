# Code Refactor Starter Code
=======
# <Marketing Site Update>

## Description

My motivation to making this project was to make sure anybody that uses the website can use it and navigate through it pain free. I built this project to make it easier for people with disablities to use the website and to help the website rank higher on Google search. This project solves the problem of people with disablities being limtied when using the website. I learned that refactoring a code is good for cleaning up a code and making it cleaner for other developers to read and add to.
